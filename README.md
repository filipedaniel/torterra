## Why is it called Torterra?

Well, if you do not know, Torterra is a Pokemon introduced on 4º generation from type Grass and Ground. As a huge Pokémon fan, I decide to use the name of one of my favorite pokemons, since I believe that makes some sense in this case.

Torterra in some pokedex entries is mentioned as: "ancient people imagined that beneath the ground, a gigantic Torterra dwelled" or "Some Pokémon are born on a Torterra’s back and spend their entire life there.”

This is a full stack application, the database layer it represents the beginning and the roots of the project up to the trees where    and is represented as “some Pokémon are born back and spend their entire life there” being the many websites or front-end application that can be build it on the top.
